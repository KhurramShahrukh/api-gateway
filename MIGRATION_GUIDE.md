# Migration Guide: Monorepo to Distributed Microservices

This guide explains how your architecture has been transformed from a monorepo to a distributed microservices setup.

## What Changed

### Before (Monorepo)
```
node-api-gateway/
├── gateway/
│   └── server.js
├── services/
│   ├── user-service/
│   │   └── server.js
│   └── product-service/
│       └── server.js
├── package.json
├── start-all.js
└── README.md
```

### After (Distributed)
```
api-gateway/ (this repo)
├── gateway/
│   ├── server.js (enhanced)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── .dockerignore
├── docker-compose.yml
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
├── scripts/
│   ├── start-services.sh
│   └── stop-services.sh
├── env.example
├── package.json (updated)
└── README.md (updated)

user-service/ (separate repo)
├── server.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
├── .dockerignore
└── README.md

product-service/ (separate repo)
├── server.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
├── .dockerignore
└── README.md
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced API Gateway
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks of all services
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Request ID Tracking**: Unique request IDs for better debugging
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible service URL configuration
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses

### 2. Independent Services
- **Separate Repositories**: Each service can be developed and deployed independently
- **Docker Support**: Each service has its own Dockerfile
- **Individual Package.json**: Independent dependency management
- **Service-Specific Documentation**: Each service has its own README

### 3. Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Easy local development setup
- **Development Mode**: Hot reload support for development
- **Production Ready**: Optimized Docker images
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring

### 4. Deployment Ready
- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud platforms
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible environment variable support
- **Scaling Support**: Horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Separate Repositories
You need to create separate Git repositories for the services:

```bash
# Create user-service repository
mkdir user-service-repo
cd user-service-repo
git init
cp -r ../user-service/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial user service"
git remote add origin <user-service-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

# Create product-service repository
mkdir product-service-repo
cd product-service-repo
git init
cp -r ../product-service/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial product service"
git remote add origin <product-service-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Update Service URLs
Update the environment variables to point to your deployed services:

```bash
# For local development
USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3002

# For production
USER_SERVICE_URL=https://user-service.yourdomain.com
PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=https://product-service.yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Deploy Services
Choose your deployment strategy:

#### Option A: Docker Compose (Local/Simple)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Option B: Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

#### Option C: Cloud Platforms
- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Instances

### 4. Set Up CI/CD
Configure continuous integration and deployment for each repository:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy Service
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and deploy
        run: |
          docker build -t ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}/service:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}/service:${{ github.sha }}
```

## Benefits of the New Architecture

### 1. **Independent Development**
- Teams can work on services independently
- Different release cycles for each service
- Technology stack flexibility per service

### 2. **Scalability**
- Scale services independently based on demand
- Resource allocation per service
- Load balancing and distribution

### 3. **Fault Isolation**
- Service failures don't affect other services
- Independent deployment and rollback
- Better error handling and recovery

### 4. **Technology Diversity**
- Each service can use different technologies
- Independent dependency management
- Gradual technology migration

### 5. **Team Organization**
- Service ownership by different teams
- Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Reduced coordination overhead

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Create separate Git repositories for user-service and product-service
- [ ] Push service code to their respective repositories
- [ ] Update API Gateway environment variables
- [ ] Test local development setup with Docker Compose
- [ ] Deploy services to your chosen platform
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Update documentation and team processes
- [ ] Train team on new architecture
- [ ] Plan for database separation (if needed)

## Support

If you encounter any issues during the migration:

1. Check the health endpoints: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
2. Review Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
3. Verify environment variables
4. Check service connectivity
5. Review the deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

The new architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling your microservices as your application grows!
